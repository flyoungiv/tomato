## Notes & Thoughts
=======
i could have saved time by only taking matches on ISO and NOC country codes but i wanted to find a solution because real life data is messy
i don't have homebrew. i don't have anything. what a time to format my computer
had to find a lookup table for country codes to convert from olympics to iso
redis?
redshift?
